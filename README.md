This is a hobby project made by Edgar ([edgargomez.es](https://edgargomez.es)) using Nextjs (Reactjs), Typescript, PokeAPI, a bit of CSS and some fun. There is also a mobile version made in React Native.

You can check both repositories here: [React Native Pokedex](https://github.com/EdgarGomez/Pokedex-React-Native) and [Nextjs Pokedex](https://github.com/EdgarGomez/Pokedex).
